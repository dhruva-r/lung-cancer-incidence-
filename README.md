# Abstract
Project aims to examine how air quality and smoking influences lung cancer incidences. By leveraging comprehensive datasets, we aim to develop a predictive model for lung cancer incidence. By integrating these critical risk factors, we seek to:

Explore how lifestyle (specifically smoking) and environmental factors (like air quality) converge to influence lung cancer risk.
Test and refine multiple predictive algorithms to identify the most accurate model for forecasting lung cancer incidence.

Though the links between environmental and lifestyle factors and lung cancer are widely recognized, there's a need for more detailed insights. Such knowledge would enable the prediction of regional incidence rates, paving the way for the implementation of preventative measures to reduce these rates.
